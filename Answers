2. Setting Up a New Repository

Go to GitHub and click New Repository.

Name your repository, choose Public/Private, and decide if you want a README or .gitignore file.

Clone the repository locally using the provided Git URL.



---

3. Importance of README File

Explains the project purpose, how to use it, and installation steps.

Acts as a guide for collaborators, making the repository easier to understand and use.



---

4. Public vs. Private Repositories

Public: Visible to everyone, great for open-source projects.

Advantage: Promotes collaboration and visibility.

Disadvantage: Code is accessible to all.


Private: Only visible to authorized users.

Advantage: Ensures confidentiality.

Disadvantage: Limited collaboration without explicit access.

5. Making Your First Commit

Initialize Git locally with git init.

Add files using git add <filename>.

Commit changes with git commit -m "Initial commit".

Push to GitHub using git push origin main.

6. Branching in Git

Branching: Creates an isolated environment for changes without affecting the main branch.

Steps:

Create: git branch <branch-name>.

Switch: git checkout <branch-name>.

Merge: git merge <branch-name> into main.




---

7. Pull Requests

A Pull Request proposes changes to a repository.

Steps:

Make changes and push them.

Open a Pull Request in GitHub.

Review and merge changes into the main branch.




---

8. Forking vs. Cloning

Forking: Copies a repository to your account, allowing independent changes. Useful for contributing to others' projects.

Cloning: Downloads a repository to your local machine for development.



---

9. Issues and Project Boards

Issues: Track bugs and feature requests.

Project Boards: Organize tasks into columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress).

Example: Assign issues to team members and track progress visually.

10. Common Challenges and Best Practices

Challenges: Merge conflicts, forgetting to commit, or working on the wrong branch.

Best Practices:

Commit often with clear messages.

Use branches for features.

Regularly pull changes from the main branch.

Resolve conflicts promptly.
